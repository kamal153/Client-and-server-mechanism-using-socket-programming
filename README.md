# client-and-server-mechanism-using-socket-programming
The two key classes from the java.net package used in creation of server and client programs are: <br>
1)ServerSocket <br>
2)socket <br><br>
A server program creates a specifi c type of socket that is used to listen for client requests (server socket), In the case of a connection request, the program creates a new socket through which it will exchange data with the client using input and output streams.
<br>Sockets provide the communication mechanism between two computers using TCP. A client program creates a socket on its end of the communication and attempts to connect that socket to a server. When the connection is made, the server creates a socket object on its end of the communication.
